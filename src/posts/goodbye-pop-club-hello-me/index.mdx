You may know me as Pop Club. That was my username when I used to run a blog about Video Games when I was about 10-11 Years old. I didn't want to use my real name at the time.

```js
import React from "react"
import Example from "./place"

export default () => <Example />
```

```html
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "rebeccapurple", padding: "20px", marginTop:
"20px", }} />
```

```html
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "tomato", padding: "20px" }} />
```

> This is a blockquote, Which perhaps shpuld be longer. after all, To be or not to be, That is the question

The Name "Pop Club" was just the concatenation of two of my favorite games at the time, Club Penguin and Poptropica. That was also what most of my content was based around. Although Later I expanded to other games.

With time as my interests changed so did my blog. And eventually I started to write more on Technology and Software Development.

Running the Pop Club Blog was one of the best experiences I've had. I met some incredible people along the way and learnt a lot.

But now Its time to Move on...

I'm super excited about this new endeavor. I have many more Projects to come and Ideas to share with you.. See you soon!
